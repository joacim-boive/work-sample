# Joacim Boive - Senior Frontend Developer - React

In this repository is a representation on what to expect when employing my services.

This is coded within a limited time frame where setup is included for Next.JS, TailWindCSS and TypeScript for a very pleasent developer experience.
There is also backend APIs setup according to resonable best practices in terms of security and performance.

Mock Service Worker is configured as well as JEST with React Testing Library so there should never be any need to mock anyhting.
